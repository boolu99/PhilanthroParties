      <h2> Pick a Cause </h2>
      <p>
        What cause speaks to your heart? What do you want to fix?
        It might be in your community, or it might be on the other side of the world.
        Big or small, it all matters. Especially if it matters to you.

    <span id="column_2" class="text-cont cont inline-block">
    <h2> Pick a Date </h2>
    <p>
      Look at your calendar. Turn something you’re already planning
      into a chance to help your cause. Birthdays, sports events,
      holidays, or even a simple Saturday afternoon with friends can
      be transformed for ultimate social impact.
    </p>
  </span>
  <span id="column_3" class="text-cont cont inline-block">
  <h2> Pick an Activity </h2>
  <p>
    Be inspired by the theme of your chosen charity! Plan activities,
    recipes, and decorations that relate to the cause. If you love animals
    and you're having a pool party, have guests bring in old towels to donate
    to shelters and bake doggie treats!

        <h1> About the Author </h1>
        <p>
          When Lulu was 10, she learned that each cup of lemonade
          she sold for $1 can provide a person in Africa with clean
          drinking water for one whole year. Inspired by the life saving
          power of even the smallest donation, she set up a Boys vs Girls
          LemonAID challenge for her fifth grade class.  They exceeded all
          expectations by raising $4,000 and had so much fun doing it that her
          classmates didn't want to stop. So she founded LemonAID Warriors to
          share creative action plans and provide PhilanthroParty
          Planning Guides to make social activism a part of her generation's social life.

          Eight years later, LemonAID Warriors has raised over $100,000,
          provided clean water for thousands of people in Africa, sent hundreds of
          children to school, and supported dozens of other local and global charities.
          Lulu's PhilanthroParty Campaigns have reached over 4.2 million people
          through her partnership with corporations like Mattel. She especially
          loves to mentor other young Warriors to launch their very own charity projects.
          As a Global Youth Ambassador for A World At School, her recent advocacy
          efforts supporting equal access to safe education have been
          highlighted during the United Nation's Sustainable Development Summitt where she co-hosted a historic Town Hall event.
