      <h2> Pick a Cause </h2>
      <p>
        What cause speaks to your heart? What do you want to fix?
        It might be in your community, or it might be on the other side of the world.
        Big or small, it all matters. Especially if it matters to you.

    </span>
    <span id="column_2" class="text-cont cont inline-block">
    <h2> Pick a Date </h2>
    <p>
      Look at your calendar. Turn something you’re already planning
      into a chance to help your cause. Birthdays, sports events,
      holidays, or even a simple Saturday afternoon with friends can
      be transformed for ultimate social impact.
    </p>
  </span>
  <span id="column_3" class="text-cont cont inline-block">
  <h2> Pick an Activity </h2>
  <p>
    Be inspired by the theme of your chosen charity! Plan activities,
    recipes, and decorations that relate to the cause. If you love animals
    and you're having a pool party, have guests bring in old towels to donate
    to shelters and bake doggie treats!

        <h1> About the Author </h1>
        <p>
          As a young girl, Lulu was frustrated by the lack of
          volunteer opportunities for children.
          She began hosting her own social-good get-togethers that
          involved selling lemonade for charity. In 2010, one of these gatherings
          raised $4,000.00 to help the earthquake victims in Haiti. Empowered by this success,
          her friends begged her to host more events. So, Lulu created many more PhilanthroParty action plans,
          and as a result, her youth activism organization <a id="LWlink" href="http://www.lemonaidwarriors.com/" target="_blank">LemonAID Warriors</a> was born.
          LemonAID Warriors has since raised over $120,000, provided clean water
          for thousands of people in Africa, sent hundreds of children to school,
           and supported dozens of other local and global charities.
           Lulu's online PhilanthroParty Campaigns have so far reached
           over 4.2 million people. Lulu's speaks about activism and holds workshops
           across the country. She strongly believes in her generation's ability
           to conquer the challenges that face our world today.
